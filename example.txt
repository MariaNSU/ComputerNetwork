Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages follow a specific format that consists of a start-line, headers, a blank line, and an optional message body. Here is a general overview of the format of an HTTP message:

1. Start-Line: The start-line is the first line of an HTTP message and contains information about the request or response type. It consists of the following components:
   - For a request message:
     - Method: The HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) indicating the action to be performed.
     - Request-URI: The path to the requested resource on the server.
     - HTTP Version: The version of the HTTP protocol being used (such as HTTP/1.1).
   - For a response message:
     - HTTP Version: The version of the HTTP protocol being used.
     - Status Code: A three-digit numerical code indicating the status of the response (such as 200 for OK, 404 for Not Found).

2. Headers: After the start-line, HTTP messages contain headers that provide additional information about the message. Each header consists of a name-value pair separated by a colon (:) and followed by a line break. Common headers include:
   - Host: The domain name of the server.
   - Content-Type: The type of data in the message body.
   - Content-Length: The length of the message body in bytes.
   - Other headers for authentication, caching, cookies, etc.

3. Blank Line: After the headers, there is a blank line (CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed) that separates the headers from the message body. It indicates the end of the headers section.

4. Message Body: The message body is optional and contains data being sent with the request or response, such as form data, JSON, XML, or files. The presence of a message body depends on the type of request or response being sent.

Here is an example of a simple HTTP request message:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html


And an example of a simple HTTP response message:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Example Page</h1>
</body>
</html>

The format of HTTP messages may vary depending on the specific request or response being sent and the headers and content included in the message.
